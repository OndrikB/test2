# How to use

When starting, input the text file that you want to be tested on (syntax is that questions and answers are separated by newlines)

Then, you can flip the questions and answers if you want.

# How it works

You're asked the question and have to put in the answer. If you're wrong, the answer gets displayed and you have to put it in again. 

When you're through with all of the questions, the program will start another round where it will ask you all the questions you previously got wrong.

Repeat until nothing is wrong, at which point the program will generate a testing log including the time everything took and per-round percentages of right/wrong.
